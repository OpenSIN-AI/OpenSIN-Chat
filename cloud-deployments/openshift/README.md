# OpenShift Deployment Template for OpenSIN Chat

This directory contains a specialized Dockerfile and entrypoint script for deploying OpenSIN Chat on **Red Hat OpenShift** clusters.

## Why This Template Exists

OpenShift has a unique security model that differs from standard Docker/Kubernetes deployments:

1. **Arbitrary UIDs**: OpenShift runs containers with randomly assigned user IDs (UIDs) that don't exist in `/etc/passwd`
2. **GID 0 Requirement**: All containers run with GID 0 (root group) as the primary group
3. **Restricted SCCs**: The default Security Context Constraints (SCCs) prevent containers from running as specific users

These requirements are incompatible with the standard OpenSIN Chat Docker image, which uses a fixed `openafd` user with UID/GID 1000.

## Key Differences from Standard Dockerfile

| Feature | Standard Docker | OpenShift Template |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| File ownership | `openafd:openafd` | `openafd:0` (root group) |
| File permissions | Standard | Group-writable (`g+w`) |
| `/etc/passwd` | Read-only | Group-writable for UID injection |
| Supplementary groups | None | Added to group 0 |
| Entrypoint | Standard | Handles arbitrary UID scenarios |

## When to Use This Template

Use this template **only** if you are deploying to:
- Red Hat OpenShift (any version)
- OKD (OpenShift Origin)
- Any Kubernetes cluster with OpenShift-style restricted SCCs

**Do NOT use this for:**
- Standard Docker deployments
- Docker Compose
- Generic Kubernetes (use the standard image with appropriate `securityContext`)
- Cloud container services (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Instances)

## Building the Image

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f cloud-deployments/openshift/Dockerfile -t openafd:openshift .
```

For multi-architecture builds:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f cloud-deployments/openshift/Dockerfile \
  -t your-registry/openafd:openshift \
  --push .
```

## Deploying to OpenShift

### Using `oc` CLI

```bash
# Create a new project (namespace)
oc new-project openafd

# Create a deployment
oc new-app your-registry/openafd:openshift

# Expose the service
oc expose svc/openafd --port=3001

# Set required environment variables
oc set env deployment/openafd \
  STORAGE_DIR=/app/server/storage \
  JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

### Using a DeploymentConfig YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: openafd
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: openafd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: openafd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: openafd
        image: your-registry/openafd:openshift
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
        env:
        - name: STORAGE_DIR
          value: /app/server/storage
        - name: JWT_SECRET
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: openafd-secrets
              key: jwt-secret
        volumeMounts:
        - name: storage
          mountPath: /app/server/storage
      volumes:
      - name: storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: openafd-storage
```

## Persistent Storage

OpenShift PersistentVolumeClaims work with this image. Ensure the PVC is created before deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: openafd-storage
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors

If you see permission errors, verify:
1. You're using this OpenShift-specific image, not the standard one
2. The PVC has correct access modes
3. No custom SCCs are overriding the default behavior

### User Not Found in passwd

The entrypoint script automatically handles this by injecting a passwd entry at runtime. If issues persist, check that `/etc/passwd` is group-writable in your image.
